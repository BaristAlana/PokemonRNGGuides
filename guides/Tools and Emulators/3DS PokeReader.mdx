PokeReader is a plugin to help RNG by bringing emulator-like functionality to physical consoles.

For how to install PokeReader on a 3DS emulator, [go here](/install-pokereader-emu).

## Tools

- [A 3DS with CFW (Custom Firmware)](https://3ds.hacks.guide/)
- [Luma version 13.0.0 or higher](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases)

## Install PokeReader on 3DS

1. Download the [latest release of PokeReader](https://github.com/zaksabeast/PokeReader/releases/latest).
2. Create the `/luma/plugins` folder if it does not exist.
3. Copy `default.3gx` to the `/luma/plugins/` folder.
4. Open Rosalina (`L` + `Down` + `Select`) and enable the `Plugin Loader`.

## Troubleshooting

**PokeReader does not load and my game crashes!**

Make sure you have updated the game to the latest version. PokeReader will not work on older game versions.

Game updates can be downloaded from the Nintendo eShop.
