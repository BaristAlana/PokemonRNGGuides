PokeReader is a 3gx plugin that replaces PokeCalc. It has more features for RNG purposes.

## Tools

- A 3DS with CFW (Custom Firmware). Instructions for installing CFW can be found at [3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/).
- [Luma version 13.0.0 or higher](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases).

## Install PokeReader on 3DS

1. Download the [latest release of PokeReader](https://github.com/zaksabeast/PokeReader/releases/latest).
2. Copy `pokereader.3gx` to `/luma/plugins/default.3gx` on your SD card, or to `/luma/plugins/<title_id>/plugin.3gx` for each Pokémon game. Create the directory if it does not exist.
3. Open Rosalina and enable the "Plugin Loader".

If you are migrating from the Plug n' Play version of PokeReader, follow the [Plug n' Play uninstallation guide](https://github.com/zaksabeast/3ds-Plug-n-play#uninstalling).
