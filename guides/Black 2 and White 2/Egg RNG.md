**Note : This is a rough draft, like I always do. So to make things interesting, I'll assume that the reader has the basic knowledge in Gen 5 RNG. It implies to know how to calibrate a profile, hit an initial seed and to use PokeFinder. This guide can be used for Retail without any issue even if the setup is based on emu**

## Requirements

- PokeFinder
- All the tools necessary based on your method (EonTimer, Luas)
- Access to the Daycare
- IVs of your Parents

## Part 1 : Setup

So this part is quite basic. You'll find 2 parents. You'll open PokeFinder, go to Gen 5 Tab => Egg. You'll write the IVs of the Parents, add all the details necessary. It's not necessary to go for setting up the part to research a target frame right now.

In game, you'll deposit your parents, and you'll walk until having an egg ready. Save here. (I suggest to save inside the Daycare house if retail to avoid the advancements for the next part)

Now, the idea is simple. Egg RNG in BW2 is different than in BW1. The main difference is that IVs and PID are separated. We'll do first a IV RNG and then the PID part. Obviously, if you're interested in only one of the parts, you can skip directly to the right that interest you.

## Part 2 : IV RNG

So we could compare that to Gen 6 Egg RNG, where you'll RNG a seed and IVs for the next egg. The good part is because how BW2 egg RNG is done, you'll not need to hit a specific frame. **Only hitting the Initial Seed will matter**.

So back to PokeFinder, input the IVs you'd like. **No need to search for Shiny, natures etc. It's useless !**

Find an Initial Seed and hit it. Once you're sure to have hit the right initial Seed, you can talk to the Old Man and **reject the egg** ! It's really important.

Once done, walk again. And once you have an egg ready. Save next to the old man.

If you just wanted IVs, you can grab the egg. The RNG is done. Otherwise let's heads up to the next part.

## Part 3 : PID RNG

Finally, the PID RNG part. In fact, this works the same as BW Egg RNG.

Come back to PokeFinder. Remove all the IVs filters (0-31 back) and now put filters for the PID part (Natures, Ability, Gender, Shininess) and then search for a target.

Once done, hit the Initial Seed, advance the frames, and talk to the man to take the egg.

**! With PokeFinder and PID part, you'll need to talk to the man one advance earlier than your target. If your target is at 100 Advances, talk to him at 99 !**

You should now have the egg with everything you wanted !
