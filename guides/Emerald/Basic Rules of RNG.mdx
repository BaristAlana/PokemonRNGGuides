## RNG Methods

- For stationary Pokémon: Method 1
- For wild encounters: Method H-2

The different methods for wild encounters are caused by vblank, though H-2 is the most commonly seen.

### Painting RNG

Painting RNG is a great method to obtain any desired initial seed. It's a more advanced technique and is covered in [this guide](/emerald-painting-rng).

## Trainer Card Flip

In Gen 3, flipping your Trainer Card resets noise-related delays, helping you focus on the default delay. You should do this almost every RNG.

To flip your trainer card, access your Trainer Card and press `A`.

You can do this between 10,000 - 5,000 advances before your target advance.

## Speeding Up RNG Advances

### Battle Video

This method helps with seeding by preserving the RNG's state as an initial seed. Engage in a battle at the Battle Frontier and save it as a video. The video retains the seed from the battle, allowing you to set it as the initial seed when loading. For example, if your target is 1 million advances away, go up to 950k, save a battle video, and upon loading, you'll start at 950k advances.

While this method is helpful, it's a bit outdated compared to Painting RNG. However, it’s useful when you need to hit a specific advance multiple times.

### In-Battle

Being in battle advances RNG twice as fast. This is particularly helpful for wild Pokémon RNG.
