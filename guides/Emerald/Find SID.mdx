# Existing Save

## From an already caught shiny

If you have already caught or bred a shiny Pokemon, this Pokemon can be used to deduce what your SID is.

## Tools

- [PokeFinder](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/PokeFinder/releases)

## Step 1: Find IVs

1. Use EV-reducing berries if the Pokémon has battled to reset EVs.
2. Open PokeFinder and go to Tools > IV Calculator.
3. Input the Pokémon's info to determine its IVs.

## Step 2: Find SID

1. In PokeFinder, open Gen 3 Tools > IVs to PID.
2. Enter the Pokémon’s IVs, nature, and your Trainer ID.
3. Search for results and determine the correct method:
   - Wild Pokémon: Methods 1-4.
   - Legendaries: Method 1.
4. If multiple SIDs appear, attempt to RNG a shiny using each until you find the correct one.

## Extracting Save

## Transferring up a Pokemon

If you do not have a shiny Pokemon, then there are other ways to determine what the SID is. The following methods can be used with any Pokemon from your game.

### With CFW 3DS or CFW Switch

Transfer a Pokemon up to a 3DS or Switch game.
