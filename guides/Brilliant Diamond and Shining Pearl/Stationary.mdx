Important note: We're looking for more delays and last screen (last input before generating a spread) for these Pokémon. Feel free to open an issue here or send a message on Discord with any delay/information based on the Chatot site.

For this guide, we assume you know how to use CaptureSight and the Chatot site for setup. You should understand how to advance your states and manage noise. Use the Stationary tab on the Chatot site. Remember to check "Set IVs" if the Pokémon has 3 IVs guaranteed, indicated next to the Pokémon.

This guide provides basic information about delays and specific setups. Everything else is covered in basic knowledge guides.

It's also important to set up a gender rate if you don't aim for a genderless Pokémon (and vice versa). The game uses a check there, so skipping this could lead to different results for the Pokémon's Nature.

# List of Stationary

Starters:

- Delay: 64.
- Generation: "Yes" when you choose the starter in the bag.
- Notes: Save before entering the Lake. It takes around 300 frames to do the cutscene and select your starter quickly. Adjust if you have a different setup, but the noise before the Lake will help hit the frame easily without the Pokédex.

Rotom:

- Delay: 90.
- Generation: "You thumped the TV Set."

Eevee:

- Delay: 0.
- Generation: "You obtained an Eevee!"

Dialga/Palkia (3 IVs):

- Delay: 84.
- Generation: After the text. You might need to press `A` inside the text box to press `A` to start the battle. This applies to Dialga; it's not checked with Palkia.
- Notes: Doing it post-E4 is easier because it's quieter. For that, defeat Dialga/Palkia on your first encounter, then beat the Elite 4 to have them respawn.

Giratina (3 IVs):

- Delay: 84.
- Generation: "Bishaaan!"

Heatran (3 IVs):

- Delay: 84.
- Generation: "Gwogbogogo..."

Regigigas (3 IVs):

- Delay: 84.
- Generation: "Zut Zutt!"
- Notes: Due to player blinking, the delay can be off. Usually, you’ll have a +1 or +2 delay. It's essential to test and see how it goes. These delays are based on breakpoint values, so user experiences may vary. Practice to see how your delay goes.

Ramanas Park (3 IVs):

- Delay: 84.
- Generation: Dialog box.

**Warning: Don't forget to select the Roamers method for Mesprit and Cresselia.**

Mesprit:

- Delay: 84.
- Generation: "Kyauun."
- Notes: Due to player blinking, the delay can be off. Usually, you’ll have a +1 or +2 delay. It's essential to test and see how it goes. These delays are based on breakpoint values, so user experiences may vary. Practice to see how your delay goes.

Cresselia:

- Delay: 103/104.
- Generation: Press `A` in front of her.
- Notes: Due to player blinking, the delay can be off. Usually, you’ll have a +1 or +2 delay. It's essential to test and see how it goes. These delays are based on breakpoint values, so user experiences may vary. Practice to see how your delay goes.

**Warning: PokeFinder supports Mystery Gift Generation. Download the right event information here: https://projectpokemon.org/home/files/category/203-generation-8/ and load it with PokeFinder for accurate results.**

Mystery Gift (Can be 3 IVs):

- Delay: 0.
- Generation: The moment you select the event in the menu to claim.
- Notes: Similar to egg RNG; where you claim it is important. The best place to do that is in the player's room, where everything is quiet.
