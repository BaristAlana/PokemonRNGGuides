First, an important note. PokeFinder does not have an official release for BDSP RNG yet. For now, it’s safer to use it only for Egg and TID/SID RNG. Everything will be updated after the official release.

You MUST download a version of PokeFinder after the 6aab415 commit from 12.09.2021. Older builds handled states differently, which may lead to incorrect RNG.

PokeFinder is the universal RNG tool. This guide focuses on the Gen 8 tab when you launch it.

While it’s useful for Eggs, it’s important to set up your profile first. On the main menu, click on "Gen 8 Tools" and then "Profile Manager." Create profiles for BDSP. The TID/SID needed is not the G7/G8 TID. Use Pkhex and hover over the TID/SID info to get the correct numbers.

PokeFinder uses only 2 states. If you use the luats for Yuzu/Ryujinx, 4 states will be displayed by default. Press `6` on your keyboard to switch to u32 state display and input values from the Initial Seed section in the same order.

CaptureSight uses 4 states. Input the seeds in order:

- Seed 0 of PokeFinder = Seed 0 and Seed 1 of CaptureSight.
- Seed 1 of PokeFinder = Seed 2 and Seed 3 of CaptureSight.

Once the tab opens for your desired RNG, check "Use Delay" and enter the delay matching the values shown in our guides.

(Later, we will explain how to use the filters for Stationary and Wild.)
